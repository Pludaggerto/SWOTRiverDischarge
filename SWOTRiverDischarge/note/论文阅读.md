# Inversion of river discharge from remotely sensed river widths: A critical assessment at three-thousand global river gauges

## 摘要

- Our daily discharge inversions (1984–2019) showed positive Kling-Gupta Efficiency (KGE) at 27% of the gauges for BAM and 39% for geoBAM

## 引言

- MCFLI is particularly promising as it requires much less computation for large-scale applications compared to DA while retaining the probabilistic way of Q estimation.

## 数据和方法

- To provide a stern test for global RSQ, we first identified all gauged rivers observable by Landsat. A global database with >14,000 gauges was used here

# 结论
(e.g., low-b channels, arid climate, low/high width variability, high LAI, and wide rivers; the wide river group calls for a better differentiation for channel-like reservoirs, as well as improving the geomorphic priors in geoBAM).
